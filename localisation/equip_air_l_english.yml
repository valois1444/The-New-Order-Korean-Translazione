 ### General Improvements ###
  jet_equipment_engines:0 "제트엔진"
  jet_equipment_engines_desc:0 "Developed in the weaning days of the second world war, jet engines operate by mixing super-compressed air with highly reactive jet fuel, igniting the mixture, and expelling highly energetic gases from the exhaust, generating far more thrust than conventional turbine aircraft."

We can achieve this through the use of a flying boom system: a tanker aircraft uses an extended tube to supply fuel to another plane. Through this fairly simple concept, our aircraft can reliably carry out longer missions. The only limit will be crew fatigue!"
